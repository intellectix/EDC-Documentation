The homepage of the EDC dashboard provides a high level overview of how the attached system is functioning.

At the top of the page, there are three quick statistics highlighting the number of database requests, unique requestors and number of failed requests for the day. These numbers are dynamic and update each time the page is refreshed.

Below the scoreboard, there are two graphs which highlight a breakdown of the different types of requests the system has received today as well as the number of requests each day for the past 7 days.

Below the graphs, there is a table which shows the 10 most recent requests to the database. These requests can be selected to bring up a modal which shows the full logging information for each request. To see a list of all the requests, go to the `Requests` tab on the left side of the page.
