The EDC allows developers to create system users inside of the EDC Dashboard. The EDC takes care of the entire lifecycle of a user, making it very easy for developers to manage which users can access which information.

Users created in the EDC dashboard have no permissions to access the database until they are assigned to a Role. 

## Adding a User

To add a user in the EDC Dashboard, select Users on the left side of the page. Then, select 'Add User'. Fill in the username and status and then select 'Save'.

The newly created User can now be assigned to a [Role](roles.md).

## Editing a User

To edit a User, select the User's name on the Users homepage. Then, update the users details and select 'Save'. The User's new details have now been updated throughout the system.

## Deleting a User

To delete a User, navigate to the User Home page. Thenm select the `X` next to the associated User. This user will be removed from the system, and all privileges will be revoked.
