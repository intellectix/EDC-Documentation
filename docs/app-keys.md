App keys enable developers to control which users have access to certain applications. This feature is very beneficial when the EDC is hosted as a web API, because the EDC can simultaneously support requests from multiple applications at once without developers needing to create special user permissions for each application. Developers can create new apps, create an App Key for that app, and then provide access to Users as needed. 

## Adding an App Key

To add an App Key, select `App Keys` on the left side of the dashboard. Then, select `Add Application`. Fill in the requested information, then select `Save`. The Members tab will then be unlocked, allowing Developers to add Users to the application.

## Editing an App Key

To edit an App Key, navigate to the App Key's Home page, then select the name of the App Key to edit. The App Key's information will be populated. Edit the information, then select `save` to update the App Key's information. 

If an App Key's information is updated, it will not affect the Users that have been granted access to the application.

## Add Members to an App

To add Members, select the App Key from the list to be directed to that Application's Edit page. Select the Members tab, then click `Add Member`. Select the Users to be added to the application, then select `Save`. The newly added users will be able to interact with that application.

## Deleting Members from an App

To delete Members from an App, navigate to the App's Edit page, then select the Members tab. Then, select the `X` next to the name of the User to be deleted. The User will then have all application access removed.

## Deleting an App Key

To delete an App Key, navigate to the App Key Home page. Then, select the `X` next to the associated App Key to be deleted. The App Key will then be removed from the system.
